The person who manages local deployment of a SLATE edge cluster. 

Examples:
* Shawn McKee for the University of Michigan SLATE edge cluster within the physics department

Requirements:
* A reliable and automated way to install a SLATE edge cluster (e.g. build from the network or local media).
* Allocate resource to SLATE virtual organization within a platform

Responsibilities:
* Basic hardware support (racking, cabling, replacing failed hardware, etc) 
* Initial setup (running the installer, inputting basic network configuration)

(Lincoln) One may imagine a deployment guide for edge administrators that looks something like [this](https://openconnect.netflix.com/deploymentguide.pdf).
