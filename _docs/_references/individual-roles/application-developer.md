The person that takes an existing application and packages in a way that
can be installed on a SLATE platform. A SLATE application developer may be
a part of a SLATE virtual organization (developing an application for their
specific use), may be part of the SLATE core team (developing an application
for use in all platforms) or may be external to SLATE (making sure that their
application, which is external to SLATE, can also run within SLATE). As part
of the development of the application, the SLATE application developer will
need to deploy a development version, test it at scale, debug it and redeploy.

For advanced use cases, the SLATE application developer may need to be aware
of the underlying implementation and be able to develop against it.

Examples:
* The developers and packagers of edge applications
* Science gateway developers. (aside: c.f. https://sciencegateways.org/) 

Requirements:
* The ability to deploy at scale and debug the application

Responsibilities:
* Define the recipe for installation, including the configuration parameters
