The person who administers a SLATE application service on a SLATE platform.
A SLATE application administrator may be a part of a virtual organization
(deploying an application for their specific use) or may be a SLATE platform
administrator (installing basic services that are available to all SLATE virtual
organizations).

The SLATE application administrator should able to perform his tasks without
relying directly on Kubernetes. A set of SLATE tools should be provided that
match the SLATE application administrator use cases and that can be remapped
to different implementation and technology in future versions of SLATE.

Examples:
* A person who deploys and operates a software caching service across multiple sites
* Science gateway operator

Requirements:
* A catalog of applications ready to be installed on the SLATE platform
* Ability to customize the application parameters accordingly

Responsibilities:
* Satisfy the needs of the application users
