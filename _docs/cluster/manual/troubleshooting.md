At this point, you should have a functioning and federated SLATE cluster. If you have any questions on this process, please [contact our team](/community/) for assistance. Below we have provided some solutions to problems that folks have occasionally come across.

### "slate cluster create" command hangs and times out
#### Problem Description
Sometimes the "slate cluster create" command will hangfor a period of time and then fail. This is usually because the underlying `kubectl` command used by the SLATE client is misconfigured. You may want to check to see if `kubectl` commands can complete normally. If you get an error the type:

(starting with Kubernetes v1.18)

``` 
error: no configuration has been provided, try setting KUBERNETES_MASTER environment variable
```

or

 (pre Kubernetes v1.18)
 
```
The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
```
#### Possible Solution
Try setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the correct location (usually `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` or `~/.kube/config`)
