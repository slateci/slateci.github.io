Once your application is tested, you may want to add it to the catalog following this procedure.

1. Fork the [SLATE incubator application catalog](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog-incubator) and add your application to `charts/`.
   * Consult the [README.md](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog-incubator/blob/master/README.md) of the repository for all the technical questions.
2. Open a pull request in GitHub.
   * The SLATE developers will review and test your application to make sure it fits the guidelines.
   * They may contact you back for modification.
4. Once the application is approved, it will be merged in the incubator catalog and will become available for installation with the standard SLATE tools.
5. Continue testing the application as it stands in the incubator catalog to make sure it functions properly with the rest of the SLATE distributed infrastructure.
6. Once you are satisfied, contact the SLATE team and request the application be promoted to the [stable catalog](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog-stable).
7. The SLATE developers will review the request and move the application in the [stable catalog](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog-stable).
