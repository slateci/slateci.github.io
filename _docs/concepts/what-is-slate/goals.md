The overarching SLATE design drivers are:

* SLATE must be DevOps friendly for multi-campus platform builders and science gateway deployers
* SLATE must allow for quick patch updates, release iterations, and fast tracking of new capabilities
* SLATE should use best of breed open source technologies for growth and sustainability
* SLATE must provide centralized monitoring & analytics for all layers in the system - edge clusters, applications
* SLATE must collaborate with national cyberinfrastructure for science projects
