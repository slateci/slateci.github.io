The primary goal of SLATE is to accelerate collaborative science. SLATE augments the canonical [Science DMZ pattern](http://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/) with a secure container orchestration platform and trust model.

The platform permits hosting of containerized services needed for higher-level capabilities such as [data transfer nodes](http://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/DTN/), software and data caches, workflow services and science gateway components. 

SLATE is using Kubernetes as an underlying technology to implement these capabilities.
