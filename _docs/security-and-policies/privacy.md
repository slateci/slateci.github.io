This Privacy Policy explains how the SLATE Platform ("SLATE") treats data by which you can be personally identified (“Personal Data”) as a result of your registration for and use of SLATE. 

SLATE collects the following Personal Data to identify you to enable us to grant you access to the SLATE Platform and the resources such as computing, storage, and network that its participants offer:

- Name
- Email address
- Telephone number
- Institutional affiliation
- Identifiers, as provided by identity providers such as a Home Institution or from third parties such as Globus

Your Personal Data will be made available to other users of SLATE only for purposes of enabling collaborative use of SLATE. By using SLATE you agree to keep confidential such information made available to you about other users. 

Your usage of SLATE will be logged. Records of this use, containing your Personal Data, may be shared with the SLATE Platform Administrators, Edge Administrators, Application Administrators, and security teams supporting these for operational, security and accounting purposes only. These records will be purged or anonymized after, at latest, 12 months.

You can contact SLATE's Platform Administrators at security@slateci.io to obtain a copy of your Personal Data, request that it is corrected in case of factual error, or if you suspect that it has been misused. You can also request that we stop using your Personal Data, but this will affect your access to SLATE.
