Applications that have been validated for deployment on a SLATE platform can be found in the
[SLATE application catalog](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog).

Once your application is tested, you may want to add it to the catalog following this procedure.

1. Fork the [SLATE application catalog](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog) and add your application in the
incubating section. Please, consult the README of the repository for all the technical questions.
1. Open a pull request. The SLATE developers will review and test your application to make sure it fits the guidelines.
They may contact you back for modification.
1. Once the application is approved, it will be merged in the main catalog and will become available for installation
with the standard SLATE tools.
1. Further test the application as it stands in the catalog to make sure it functions properly with the rest of
the SLATE distributed infrastructure.
1. Once you are satisfied, issue a ticket on the [SLATE application catalog](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog) to
request that the application is promoted to the main catalog.
1. The SLATE developers will review the ticket and move the application in the main catalog.
