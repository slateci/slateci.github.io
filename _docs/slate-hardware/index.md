SLATE can operate with most any Kubernetes based cluster.  Here we provide three configurations we are using for the the reference SLATE platform which uses clusters at University of Michigan, UChicago, and University of Utah.

The reference platform includes dedicated network measurement hardware (PerfSONAR node) and an out-of-band management node that is able to bootstrap a SLATE cluster.
