[Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/) is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. It's an alternative to squid, the web caching service that the atlas community is familiar with. Slate recently release two Varnish charts. 
- [v4a](https://portal.slateci.io/applications/v4a) creates a Varnish instance that is configured to proxy Frontier requests. 
- [v4cvmfs](https://portal.slateci.io/applications/v4cvmfs) creates a Varnish instance that is configured to proxy CVMFS requests

In this blog post, we will introduce Varnish, it's current deployment status at slate sites and show comparisons of Varnish and Squid side by side.

## Varnish Overview

Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture. A high level overview of what Varnish does can be seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD14ChpcL4).

## Varnish vs Squid

Squid and Varnish are both open source tools. Varnish with 908 GitHub stars and 216 forks on GitHub appears to be more popular than Squid with 560 GitHub stars and 202 GitHub forks.

    <td>A caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Squid reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and makes a great server accelerator. It runs on most available operating systems, including Windows and is licensed under the GNU GPL; </td>

## Deployment Status

Currently Varnish is deployed at both AGLT2 and MWT2

- AGLT2 : Two instances deployed as primary caches. Running there since summer. No issues of any kind.
- MWT2: Recently deployed both a v4a and a v4cvmfs instance, serving all three sub-sites (UC, IU, UIUC) and Analysis Facility.

## Monitoring

Varnish is monitored in both Elasticsearch and 
[ATLAS MRTG monitoring](http://wlcg-squid-monitor.cern.ch/snmpstats/mrtgatlas2/indexatlas2.html) like squid does. 
Reports request/fetch, in/out data rate, CPU usage, objects and file descriptors.
Response times can be compared as squid rounds them to 0 seconds.

## Performance Test Results

### CVMFS
Used [Siege](https://github.com/JoeDog/siege) to replay 100k requests with concurrency of 30. 
Varnish is six times faster!

## Summary
We showed in this post that Varnish is faster, needs less resources, and it is easy to monitor. It's a step forward toward efficiently caching Physics data over HTTP. Please refer to the chart repo on how to make deployment and we encourage you to try this out and let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions that would help us improve this chart and make it more beneficial to users. For discussion, news and troubleshooting, the [SLATE Slack workspace](https://slack.slateci.io/) is the best place to reach us!
