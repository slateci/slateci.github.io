In this blog post, we explain the steps for creating a [k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster, registering 
it with SLATE, and then deploying a SLATE application to the cluster.

Kubernetes (K8s) is a powerful container orchestration tool. [k3s](https://k3s.io) is a lightweight distribution of Kubernetes that strips out unnescassary features while remaining fully compliant with up-stream Kubernetes. It allows easier deployment when compared to kubeadm and all in a binary less than 40MB.

[k3s](https://k3s.io) is a fantastic solution for deploying Kubernetes with SLATE on smaller devices, older hardware, and even IOT. 

[k3s](https://k3s.io) is an open-source Kubernetes distribution provided by [Rancher Labs](https://rancher.com/). It is easy to install and uses half the memory of a standard Kubernetes installation. This is useful for many environments where resources are limited. As more users have been exploring k3s and leveraging edge computing for applications in different domains including science and research, we thought we’d try it out with our SLATE platform. This will provide a way to make the SLATE platform more accessible to institutions who are interested in leveraging SLATE for lightweight applications, such as the perfSONAR testpoint.

<!--end_excerpt-->

First, let’s go through an installation of k3s. We'll start with a virtual machine 
which we've given a public IP address. Many of the following commands need to be 
run as superuser, so it is probably a good idea to sudo su - before beginning.  
Our virtual machine came with a fresh installation of [CentOS 7](https://www.centos.org/download), 
so we'll assume that here.

## Prepare the operating system

Run the operating system requirements steps in the [SLATE cluster installation docs](https://slateci.io/docs/cluster/)

	#Install yum utils
	yum install yum-utils -y

	#Disable SELinux
	setenforce 0
	sed -i --follow-symlinks 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/sysconfig/selinux

    #Disable swap
	swapoff -a
	sed -e '/swap/s/^/#/g' -i /etc/fstab

	#Disable firewalld
	systemctl disable --now firewalld

	#Disable root login over ssh
	sed -i --follow-symlinks 's/#PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

	#Use iptables for Bridged Network Traffic
	cat <<EOF > /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
	net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
	net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
	EOF
	sysctl --system

## Install Docker

Install Docker. We recommend using the Docker CE runtime with SLATE and k3s

	# Add Docker stable repo to Yum
	yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

	# Install the latest version of DockerCE and container 
	yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y

	# Enable Docker on reboot through systemctl
	systemctl enable --now docker

## Run k3s

Run the k3s install script

	curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

## Enable kubeconfig for kubectl access

KubeConfig

To enable kubectl access for root, copy the k3s yaml file to $HOME/.kube/config

	mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
	cp -f /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml $HOME/.kube/config	
	chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

To enable kubeconfig for a single session instead run

	export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

## Modify the kubeconfig for SLATE

Make sure the server’s address in the kube config file is pointing to a public IP address. Refer to the sample file below to see where the public IP address needs to be added

Here is a sample k3s yaml file 

	apiVersion: v1
	clusters:
	- cluster:
	   certificate-authority-data: '<data redacted>'
	   server: https://localhost:6443 # <- Change localhost to your public IP or DNS name
	 name: kubernetes
	contexts:
	- context:
	   cluster: kubernetes
	   user: kubernetes-admin
	 name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
	current-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
	kind: Config
	preferences: {}
	users:
	- name: kubernetes-admin
	 user:
	   client-certificate-data: '<data redacted>'
	   client-key-data: '<data redacted>'

Check for a master k3s node by running

	kubectl get nodes

The following step is not required for k3s as the master node is already untainted when k3s is installed

	//kubectl taint nodes k3d-k3s-default

## Deploy pod network (Calico)

Download calico.yaml file using

	wget https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.8/manifests/calico.yaml

Update CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR  value on line 625 of the calico.yaml file to k3s server default ip for example 10.42.0.0/16

Apply calico.yaml file by running

	kubectl apply -f calico.yaml

## Deploy the load balancer (Metallb)

Follow the Load Balancer part of the [SLATE cluster installation document](https://slateci.io/docs/cluster/) and apply the metallb.yaml file to your cluster and create the ConfigMap for MetalLB to your cluster after changing the IP address range in the metallb-config.yaml file.

## Install the SLATE client

Install SLATE in your k3s cluster  by following the [SLATE installation](https://portal.slateci.io/cli) instructions

## Join the cluster to SLATE

Create the k3s SLATE cluster by running a command similar to the one provided below. Change the name of the cluster, group, org

	./slate cluster create umich-k3s-test --group slate-dev-testing2 --org SLATE

In the above example the cluster name is umich-k3s-test

## Deploy an application

Deploy an application to your k3s SLATE cluster by following Deploying an Application
part in the [SLATE CLI docs](https://slateci.io/docs/tools)

Note: If you need to uninstall k3s run the command below

	/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh

In summary, we were able to successfully set up a k3s cluster in a virtual environment and deploy a SLATE application to the k3s cluster in less than an hour.
