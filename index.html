                    <p>
                        Much of modern research is propelled by collaborations across multiple institutions. These collaborations require computing environments
                        that connect data and computational resources across combinations of university research computing centers, national high-performance
                        computing facilities, and public cloud providers. The scale of the data and complexity of the science drive the need to aggregate resources
                        from many sources into scalable computing systems. A vast array of dependencies, specifications, and processes across these sites can cause
                        scientists to spend more time on the technical aspects of computation and data management than on the science itself.

                        Services Layer At The Edge (SLATE) provides technology that simplifies connecting university and laboratory data center capabilities to 
                        the national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem. Introducing the SLATE stack to these sites enables science users to work on research rather 
                        than technicalities, saves support staff significant amounts of time, and expands the reach of domain specific science gateways and 
                        multi-site research platforms.

                    <h2 class="text-center doc-call-title">Why SLATE?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Deploying science services across national and international distributed infrastructures is hard!  Rolling out hardware, Operating Systems, 
                        science applications, and science tools at every geographically discrete site requires a significant IT presence at each site.  The IT
                        personnel have to deal with the hardware, the IT software, AND the science software in order to make a science service function.  This 
                        fact requires a lot of knowledge and time on the order of days, weeks, and months.  SLATE aims to make the job easier for the local IT 
                        support person and to minimize the time to deployment for the science services.
